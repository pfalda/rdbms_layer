    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p>
        <b>DbmsLayer</b>, as the name implies, is a layer built on top of akka that handles queries towards a Relational
        DataBase Management System.
        By default it uses <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">mysql connector</a> and it can behave
        in both asynchronous and synchronous ways.
        The DbmsLayer permits you to seamlessly integrate with akka, decomposing and parallelizing the interaction of
        your application with a RDBMS.

        The <b>DbmsLayer</b> can be easly integrated with different connection pool libraries and can easily integrate
        with other JDBC drivers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thanks to akka, the <b>DbmsLayer</b> can serve high amount of requests concurrently and parse/elaborate the
        replies efficiently.
        The whole application can so be designed to be reactive top to bottom and masks almost all the blocking nature
        of JDBC.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this demo code, a few requests are performed to an existing mysql database, first from a 'normal' program and
        then from within an akka program/actor. Java >= 1.7 is required.
    </p>

    <p>
        All those handlers are reactive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lets start with the setup steps now.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Database Setup</h2>

    <p>
        In <a href="#code/src/main/resources/" class="shortcut">resources</a> you can find a <a
            href="#code/src/main/resources/TemplateDB.sql" class="shortcut">sql script</a> that can be used to create a
        database schema suitable
        for the test program. Once you have recreated such schema in your mysql instance, you can modifify
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a> filling it with
        hostname, database name, user and password
        required to connect to your rdbms instance:<br>
        <code>&nbsp;mysqldb {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host = "taurus"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 3306<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dbname = "TemplateDB"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;username = "root"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pwd = "root"<br>
            &nbsp;}<br>
        </code>

    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have completed these steps, you can successfully test this activator template
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next section, we'll do an overview of the layer architecture, and at the end, we'll see a few usage
        cases.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>Requests Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/actors/GenericDBMSQueryingActor.java" class="shortcut">GenericDBMSQuerier</a>
        is an Actor which
        deals with the sql requests. Its duties are the spawning of the underlying actor hierarchy, the logic for
        reusing it if required and
        the reply generation once the data arrives from the database. If you want to interact with DbmsLayer, you have
        to send a proper request to an actor of this kind.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/actors/DBMSWorker.java" class="shortcut">DBMSWorker</a> is
        an Actor which
        deals with the database interaction. Its duties are the connection fetching and releasing, the execution of
        explicit
        connection related DBMS commands (such as commit or rollback) and the choosing of the right dispatcher according
        to the
        request characteristics. We'll see the last point more in detail later. From an usage point of view, you will
        never deal with this kind of actor.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the <b>GenericDBMSQQueryingActor</b> is created, it spawns a <b>DBMSWorker</b>. While the connection is
        being fetched
        from the connection pool, the <b>GenericDBMSQQueryingActor</b> parses the
        <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/descriptors/QueryGenericArgument.java" class="shortcut">QueryGenerciArgument</a>
        object
        used to represent the request and extracts the info regarding the request and the expected output.
    </p>

    <h3>Request Structure</h3>

    <p>
        A <b>QueryGenericArgument</b> object is used to instruct the layer not only about a request SQL and parameters,
        but also
        regarding the <i>logical</i> behaviour of the request itself.
        A typical QueryGenericArgument object has the following fields:
        <pre>
        &nbsp;Father => The reply message will be sent to the actor specified as a father
        &nbsp;Query => The SQL query
        &nbsp;Request Properties => Logical meaning of the request, we'll see below
        &nbsp;Autocommit => Boolean that tells if a commit shall be performed after the execution of the request
        &nbsp;Reply Type => Object type that will be sent to father as reply for the whole request
        &nbsp;Argument Array => Object array that holds parameters for the SQL query
        </pre>

    A <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/descriptors/RequestModes.java" class="shortcut">Request
    Property</a>
    is used to tell the system if the specified query will alter the content of the database (<i>WRITE</i>), will just
    read it (<i>READ_ONLY</i>)
    or will perform both, as with a stored function (<i>READ_WRITE</i> ).<br>
    The request <i>may</i> have also a behavioural profile, but the behavioural logic can be actually useful only if you
    are messing up with database locks,
    so you can just ignore it and skip next section if you are not interested.

    <h3>Behavioural Logic</h3>
    If you are dealing with locks a query can sleep for a <i>long</i> time, acting as a stopper for your dispatcher.
    So, if you can't address the problem using a complete async jdbc like driver, the <b>DbmsLayer</b> provides you an
    <i>async</i> facilities system
    to reduce the impact of those issues.
    While creating a <i>RequestMode</i> object, you can specify one of these behavioural properties:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>RESOURCE GETTER</i> is a for a query that very likely would block.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>RESOURCE_RELEASER</i> is for a query can never block and is for a query that is going to release a
    resource that has been already blocked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>RESOURCE_WHATEVER</i> is for a query that should not block and should be executed as fast as
    possible because it's being executed with a block held.<br>
    The queries with behavioural properties are run on a different set of dispatchers according to their property
    instead of the default ones, in order to limit the slowdown
    of the whole DbmsLayer.<br>

    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        The <i>general facilities</i> provide support for 'normal' rdbms interaction.
        They are provided through tree kind of dispatchers: Connections Broker, CloseConnection Broker and
        DeadLettersBroker.

    <div style="width:300px;margin:auto;overflow-x: hidden;">
        <img src="tutorial/GeneralFacilities.png">
    </div>
    When a GenericDBMSQuerying actor and its hierarchy are spawned, a request is sent to a Connection Broker that's in
    charge
    for fetching a connection from the connection pool. Once the DBMSWorker has the Connection, it's in charge for
    generating
    the correct Statement for the submitted query and send it back to the GenericDBMS requester. Once the requester has
    the statement, it can build
    the proper request and send it back to the DBMSWorker, that is in charge to route it to the right dispatcher
    according to the query properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the the query has been executed, its output is sent back to the GenericDBMSQueryingActor. There an object
        of the specified output class is reflectively constructed
        using the infos contained in the class itself (number of columns and maximum number of lines) and the class
        constructor as a parser of the output. The final result is then sent back to the original requester
        leaving the hierarchy intact and ready to be used for another request through the same GenericDBMSQueryingActor,
        if any. In this way we can build a flow of queries using the same
        structure/connections, enabling us to build complex transaction friendly execution streams.
    </p>

    <h2>System Usage</h2>

    <p>
        You can use the DbmsLayer from within your akka application as shown in the <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/akkatemplate/actors/SimpleTestWorker.java" class="shortcut">SimpleTestWorker</a>
        or use
        is in a standalone application, using the generic <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/actors/brokers/DBMSQueriesBroker.java" class="shortcut">broker</a>
        for performing queries without creating your own actor system,
        as shown <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java" class="shortcut">here</a>.
        Through the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/DbmsQuery.java" class="shortcut">reuse apis</a>
        is possible to reuse hierarchies and turn them into async ones, according to your needs and your queries. It's
        possible to perform
        serveral queries, force a <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/messages/DbmsWorkerCmdRequest.java" class="shortcut">commit/rollback</a>,
        restart using the same hierarchy/connection, everything is very flexible.<br>
        As a generic guideline you can follow this generic schema:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- If you are outside an ActorSystem environment just send a <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/messages/QueryRequest.java"
            class="shortcut">QueryRequest</a> message
        to the generic query <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/actors/brokers/DBMSQueriesBroker.java"
                                class="shortcut">broker</a> as shown in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/Main.java"
                                                                               class="shortcut">Main</a> class.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- If within an ActorSystem environment you can create a new DbmsLayer request through the <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/DbmsQuery.java" class="shortcut">create_generic_fsm</a>
        function.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- You can see a DbmsLayer request as a Java Connection, so once you get a reply from it you can just
        keep asking sending a new <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/descriptors/QueryGenericArgument.java" class="shortcut">request</a>
        to the handler with a tell() or with the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/DbmsQuery.java"
                                                    class="shortcut">reuse_fsm</a> function. Transactions are preserved
        between requests made through the same handler.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;- If you are in the above case and you want to force the execution of a previously constructed <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/descriptors/QueryGenericArgument.java" class="shortcut">request</a>
        on the dedicated <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/actors/brokers/AsyncTasksBroker.java"
                            class="shortcut">async dispatcher</a>, just send the object
        to the handler through the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/disbrain/dbmslayer/DbmsQuery.java" class="shortcut">async_reuse_fsm</a>
        function. As above, transactions are preserved.
